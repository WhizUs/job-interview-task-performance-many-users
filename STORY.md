# The Story

## WhizKube Consult

As an IT consultant, you're called upon by one of your clients, WhizCorp. 
They have a team responsible for an increasingly popular web application that lets users search for and book local events. 
The tech stack consists of Angular for the frontend, Spring Boot for the backend, and PostgreSQL for the database.

Recently, the CEO of WhizCorp reaches out with a critical issue. 
There has been a surge in user complaints regarding slow load times and occasional timeouts of the application. 
He urgently needs your assistance in addressing these performance issues.

Please assess the problems and prepare for a discussion with your colleagues Alice and Bob.


## Questions to get started

* How would you initially approach this performance issue, given the client's concerns?
* What specific areas of the application would you focus on for analysis?
* In your experience, what are some common areas that often lead to performance bottlenecks in such applications?
* If there isn't a single point of failure, but rather a combination of factors affecting performance, what general solutions would you suggest?
* In which other areas could the performance issue be located, if it's not the application?
* Aside from addressing the performance issues, are there any additional pieces of advice you would offer to the client as a consultant?

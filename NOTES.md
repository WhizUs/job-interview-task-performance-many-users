# Notes

- Since no code/direct information is present, this is a very open task.
- Please think of all possibilities that could cause issues here from your own experience
- For those that are more realistic, create propositions on how to mitigate them. Feel free to use your own experience here as well
- Main part of this task is the discussion of your ideas with Alice and Bob from WhizCorp
